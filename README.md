# go-vue-pg-app-backend

This is the backend of a simple order application whose backend is built on Go, frontend is built on VueJs and database is postgres (from Heroku dyno).

The backend uses fiber (for GET api), pq (for db connection), gorm (for modeling) to create api. It runs a comprehensive query which joins tables and returns data grouped by each order with its customer and total amount data

The frontend uses vue-good-table with sorting and searching functionality to render the data

It has pagination implemented, can switch between two pages. 

It has order names, customer names, customer company names, total amount and total earned amount as per delivered quantities

We can also sort by order date, which is in AUS/Melbourne timezone (handled on postgres level)

We can also search by entering order name
